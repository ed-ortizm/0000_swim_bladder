    Fish has several methods for buoyancy in water, this methods can be classified as static lift or
    non-static lift. The difference between this two is the mechanisms fish use to move vertically in
    water. In non-static lift fish use their fins to generate drag forces which make them move up 
    or down in water. In non-static lift fish do not use mechanical aspects to move, instead they use
    their density as a parameter to modify the balance between its weight and the buoyant force 
    described by archimedes' principle. In this research we consider the static lift method use by
    fish having swim bladders. Using swim bladder fish may change its density to be greater than, 
    equal to or lower than water's density so they may move vertically.
