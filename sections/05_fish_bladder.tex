\begin{section}{Fishes and their Swim Bladder}

    Talk about the fhish and its swim bladder, then considere a model ilustrated in the picture:
    
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[scale=0.35]{./pics/fish_bladder.jpg}
    \end{center}
    
    Define the model of the fish to considere, ie, it doesn't have cavities and and its mass in 
    average is unifomly distributed before and after the bladder changes so $ m = \rho V$
